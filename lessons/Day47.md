Practice exercise

1. You are trying to save the world by biking to works. Create a collection in mongodb for tracking how commutes and the distance. A record should looks something like:

```
    {
        user: 'BJ'
        commute: 'Grocery Store'
        distances: 2
    }
```

add at least 5 sample commutes with at least 3 different users.

2. It costs about 10.72 cents per mile to drive a car. Based on this knowledge, write an aggregation to calculate the total of how much a specific user has saved.

3. Using an aggregation, construct a leaderboard, to show and rank the biggest savers in your database, including how much they have saved.
