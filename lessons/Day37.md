# Day 37

## Images, Testing

## Vocabulary

- Arrange: Import, set up any data need before running the test. For example, import the CountUp component.
- Act: Create an action that you will test your functionality against. For example, click the CountUp component 8 times.
- Assert: Define the expected output so the test runner will know whether you function behaves properly. For example: expect(count).toEqual(8);

- Spy: a spy is a fake function that you pass in to whatever you are testing. You are testing whether or not this function ever gets called. For example, pass in a spy function to onSubmit prop in a form.
