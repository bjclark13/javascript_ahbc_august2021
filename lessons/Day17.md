## Day 17

## Recording: https://grandcircus.zoom.us/rec/share/M98Tl6XhpFlrdWXY1T9eqUQFwUI6OI2PONustOLksZR6yITJk8qTFBDoLCZuBarO.NYN6L2uIp7krBHBT
passcode: ?rm1\*ZJX

## Objectives:

- What is an API?
- What are built-in ways that we can interact with an API
- Why are promises important?

## Definitions

API -- Application Programming Interface. This is a defined set of rules between two applications so that they can talk to each other. In web development, this is how the javascript in the browser interacts with the database / backend on the servers.

Promise -- A promise is a mechanism that allows you to run code once a task has finished. This is important because any API request takes time, so you can't access the data until it is ready, and you don't want your code to just freeze until the API responds.

Backend -- A running application on a server. This allows you to create and store data in a fashion that anyone can access it, and preserve it for later.

Front end -- a running application on the browser. Any data created is only stored for that user, and wiped out when the browser closes or history is cleared.

## Schedule

### 6:30 - 7:30

Lecture: APIs

Slides: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lODLLRpi4wKHsJOVr36hCkCWj2MEPu4J/view (1-42)

Resources:

- https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-promises-explained/
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-promise-async-await-in-20-minutes/

### 7:30 - 7:45

Break, explore Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/)

Some things to think about:

- What API url would return information about Luke Skywalker? How did you get there?
- What API url would return information about Luke Skywalker's home planet? How did you get there?

### 7:45 - 8:30

Lecture: Promises, Async / Await

### 8:30 - 9

Code Along: Star Wars API

### 9 - 10

API Lab

### Extra Practice

Explore https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis and find some APIs that you think would be cool to build an app with!
