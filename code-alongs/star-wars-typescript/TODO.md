## Star Wars Characters

In this exercise, we are going to create classes for Star Wars characters.

1. Let's plan our classes

- What are some unique characteristics of any character in Star Wars? (to start, name: string, goodGuy: boolean)
- What are some unique characteristics of any force user in Star Wars?
- What are some unique characteristics of any Sith in Star Wars?
- What are some unique characteristics of any Jedi in Star Wars?

2. Create the classes for each character type. (How does the inheritance go?)

3. Add the following rules:

- Any force user should be able to do battle
- Jedi can only battle Sith, Sith can only battle Jedi
- Jedi can use blue, green, or purple lightsabers.
- Sith can use red lightsabers.
